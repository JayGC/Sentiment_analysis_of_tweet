# Sentiment_analysis_of_tweet

#Description
• utilised BERT, a state-of-art transformer model, and its pretrained architecture for feature extraction to perform
sentiment analysis on a sizable dataset of about 16,00,000 tweets but used 1,00,000 random samples from it.
• The tweet data was cleaned up and optimised using effective data preprocessing techniques, ensuring that the extracted
features for sentiment analysis were of higher quality and met the input specifications of the pretrained BERT.
• During model training, the AdamW optimizer and a linear warm-up learning rate scheduler were used, resulting
in effective weight updates and stable convergence, which improved the performance of the sentiment analysis model.
• used the Mathews correlation coefficient (MCC) to assess the sentiment analysis model’s performance.MCC of
model is 0.71. This metric is dependable for gauging the strength of binary classification models.
